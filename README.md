#Data Analysis



I have spent a lot of time learning SQL, Python, and Spreadsheet skills via DataCamp. The fill in the blank style teaching and learning gave me an air of confidence that boasted my ego for longer than it should have. When I realized that that style of learning was not suitable to my learning efficiency, I quickly did supplemental things, such as take notes from the plethora of tutorials both on and off of YouTube. My journey into tech intially began with purchased courses from Udemy, but I did not have all the tools necessary to complete those courses. Now that I do, I expect that my knowledge will increase at faster pace because everything is local and at my fingertips.
